ShipOS is an edge computing platform for ships. The operating system enables a simple global development and deployment infrastructure. Get technical information, architecture drawings and code for the ShipOS over at [shipos.tech](https://shipos.tech).

The ShipOS Foundation is the membership organization that develops the Open Source ShipOS.

The Foundation is in its infancy and seeks both members and developers for greater traction.

ShipOS is already a functional, feature-rich solution. It empowers anyone to develop and deploy apps for ships. 

The vision is a democratic, crowd-sourced continuous improvement and innovation for the shipping industry.
