ShipOS is an edge computing platform for ships. The purpose of ShipOS is to enable a simple global development and deployment infrastructure.

The ShipOS Foundation ensures the development of ShipOS. 

The Foundation is in its infancy and is seeking both members and developers for greater traction.

ShipOS is already a functional, feature-rich solution. It empowers anyone to develop and deploy apps for ships. 

The vision is to enable democratic, crowd-sourced continuous improvement and innovation for the shipping industry.
